Description
Have you ever wanted to create your own meme? 
Maybe you wanted to but didn’t know if it would be good enough to post via Social Media. Well here’s your chance to see for yourself how popular your meme is. 
The MemeMe is a meme generator designed as a game for an individual(s) to create their own memes. The idea is simple. Take any blank meme files (.png and .jpg), save it to your library and add your own hilarious, sarcastic, or mind-blowing text to your preferred image In the creation pages of the application. There are no rules on how innovative your comments can be. May it be a political vendetta, comically shaming, ridiculously cute, or just a representation of your sarcasm, the text is up to you. You can create one for yourself or to compete with others. However, the goal here is just to have fun! 
Depending on which player mode you select, you can Free Play to save the image for yourself to view and share later, or play your meme in a Tournament against others, or combat a friend in the Player vs Player mode to see who wins. 

Instructions:
Click on the MemeMe project, and run the application.

You’ll be presented with our “Welcome” screen. The Welcome screen has some of examples of memes other players have made previously for individuals who aren’t quite sure what a meme is. 
Once you’re done admiring the “Welcome” screen, let’s go ahead and play.

Click on the “Go!” button to get started. 

From this page it will directly take you to the “Player Mode” option screen. Here lie the three mode buttons, “Free Play”, “Tournament”, and “Player vs. Player.” Choose the mode that you prefer to take advantage of. 
Here are the approaches you can take on which mode you choose to press and their instructions:

a.	“Free Play”: The first mode is Free Play button, where you can just create memes for yourself to store for later use or just keep to yourself. It’s your choice!

If you choose Free Play mode, you’ll be directed to the “Create” screen. 

Select “File” from the menu, click “Open” to open your library’s blanks folder containing the blank memes. Choose your meme from your folder containing your blank memes and click open once you’ve selected your meme. This will place the meme on the “Create” screen.

(Note: the “Clear all” button under the “Edit“ menu bar will clear the meme if you chose to select a new image.)

From there click “Insert” button on the screen and add your text in the text fields where you would like your text to be displayed. The top text field displays text on the top part of your meme, the middle places text in the middle of your meme and the bottom will display text at the bottom. As you type in the text fields you will see your text displayed on your meme.

Then click File in the menu bar then Save, to save your meme to your library.

The “ViewMeme” button will take you to the folder of all your memes to view.

If you would like to go back to the Welcome/Mode screen click “Home” menu option in the “ViewMeme” screen the choose which screen you wish to return to.

Once your done with your meme you can also exit at the top right corner of the page. 

b.	“Tournament”: The next mode is the Tournament button, where you and a group of friends from 3 to 16 players can compete to see whose meme is the best. The players will be coupled up in Bracket format on the “Tournament Create” screen. Next the coupled players will select a meme to compete on from your files located in your computers’ library or the blanks folder in the project. This mode is where all players can decide which of the two competitors had the best meme. The last man/woman standing from the tournament bracket on the “Tournament Create” screen will be the winner which is placed in the final standing bracket. That player will receive a “Congraulations! You Win!” message on the “Congrats” page.

Tournament Instructions:

By selecting “Tournament” mode you will be placed inside the “Choose a Player” screen that allows all players to add their names in the “New Player” text field. 

Each player types their name into the “New Player” text field then clicks the “Ok” button located underneath to insert themselves into the Player index field located on the left-hand side of the screen. 

(Note: Make sure 3 to 16 are added, if less than 3 the screen will take you back to the “Player Mode” screen. Less than 3 players will need to choose either Free Player or Player vs. Player mode.)

Once all players are added to the Player index, click the “Play” button. 

You’ll then be sent to the “Tournament Create” screen listing all the players names in the brackets. Player one being placed at the top of the coupled players (first 2, from player 1 and player two) then the last numbered player at the bottom of the bracket. 

Select the “Set” button to place player names in the selected Player brackets.

(Note: Keep in mind players are coupled in this order: Player 1 is the top most player of their coupled bracket and Player 2 is underneath their coupled partner. If there is an odd number of players, one of the brackets will be created as a “Bye” player. Meaning someone can choose to play the Bye option for fun which does not apply to the tournament its just so that the person grouped with the Bye player can have some fun while the other players compete. The winner of the two competing players will then go against the non-Bye player in the next round.) 

Once the players names are set in the Player brackets, Players will be coupled to go against will each other. The first couple of players go first in making their meme. 

Click on the “Go” button to start the game.
